BarBasic was created as a final project for my Full Stack boot camp.

BarBasic is meant to be a clothing delivery service for those who do not have time to shop for their own outfits. This full-stack app will allow users to select an item, add it to their cart, checkout, and have items delivered to their location using the postmates api.

Currently my app includes Bootstrap, A SQL database that includes inventory, pricing, and sku's for specific items. A product page created using EJS to more easily sort through each item in the DB and add them to the page.

Missing Features include most backend work:
- Logic for login page. Signup page will add neccessary information to the users DB but app does not create a specific login page currently.
- Logic for shopping cart is missing at this time meaning when users select add to cart there is not a separate page for holding items added to the cart.
- Integration of Postmates API for delivery of items.
